Recommender Systems (RS) are useful for finding relevant and interesting items for people. However, the detailed evaluation of a RS involves numerous complex facets, all of which contribute to the ultimate goal that RS performs well as a complete system in various fields. Current analysis is fragmented and fails to account for both system-centric and user-centric evaluation.

To address this problem, this paper proposed the Framework for Evaluating Recommender systems (FEVR), which involves two factors: the evaluation objectives and the evaluation design space. The evaluation design space is further divided into three design blocks: evaluation principles, experiment type, evaluation aspects.
