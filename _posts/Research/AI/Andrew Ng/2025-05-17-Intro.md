# Intro to AI

## Supervised Learning (监督学习)

Given a dataset, predict new data.

- Regression (回归): Predict a continuous value
  - e.g., predict house prices
- Classification (分类): Predict a discrete value
  - e.g., predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant

## Unsupervised Learning (无监督学习)

Given a dataset, you're asked to understand its structure.

- Cluster (聚类)  
  - e.g., Market segmentation
- Cocktail Party Problem Algorithm: Separate mixed audio signals
