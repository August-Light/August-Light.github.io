自信！

不要死守万能理由！但是也要整理。

多看几遍题！

# 家长和孩子

> 家长表扬还是批评孩子？

表扬！



心理压力

> 家长能不能偷看孩子短信或成绩单？

信任，conflict，not listen

如果能 ask for permission，大概率会允许。promote relationship，后来 give tips and advice

> 家长要不要控制孩子的零花钱？

conflict，老样子说

independent
- Method 1: e.g. 孩子和朋友出去玩，不会因为没钱买东西而伤心
- Method 2: 知道什么该买，理财能力

# 12

> Your university is organizing a series of guest lecture. Some people think speakers with controversial opinions should not be invited to speak at the university. Others believe that the university should feature a variety of speakers, regardless of their opinions. Which point of view do you support? Explain why.

不应该（难说）：
- offend students, inference school reputation
  - M1: LGBT，sensitive
  - M2: anti-government
- bad value

应该：
- 和各行各业的人交朋友 all walks of life
  - e.g. CEO, athlete, celebrities
  - expand social network (万能)
- broaden horizon
  - e.g. how to run company, situations, inspire

# 13

> Schools should spend as much time teaching students about the history of their own countries.

其实是模板题！

一，学生老忙了！学生还有好多别的科目，没时间学你历史！而且历史老难了（demanding），要背好多好多事件，很搞心态的（frustrated）！

二，历史没用（useful）！就业用不上历史知识，not necessary！

# 14

> Some university graduates choose to spend a period of time doing volunteer or community service before they start their careers. Others think it is better to start working as soon as possible after graduation. Which view do you agree with?

一，learn skills，帮你更快适应（adapt）工作环境，但这个有点难说，但是我可以说 experience（accumulate）！与此同时 exp 帮你 promotion、higher salary！

二，还可以赚钱还 student loan。这里可以攻击对方，如果上学的话会有 financial 上的 pressure

# 16

> Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: Parents should discourage their children from choosing a career that is competitive such as sports or entertainment which are less likely to make them successful.

首先这个 discourage 看着蛮离谱的，所以先选 No，说一下：

conflicts，**be too controlling over their children**，然后 sad，（以下开始说车轱辘话）inference relationship，not good for development

没思路了。

> ~~Parents should discourage their children~~ from choosing a career that is **competitive** such as sports or entertainment which are less likely to make them successful.

competitive career 有啥好处啊？锻炼人嘛！

这种工作其实是 helpful 的。e.g. sports，training process 很苦，beneficial，develop **mentality**

甚至可以说，even if 失败了，依然可以 mentality

# 买电子产品，立马买还是等一等？

- save money
  - renew own products, other competitive brands, cheaper
- reviews
  - worth, careful decision
