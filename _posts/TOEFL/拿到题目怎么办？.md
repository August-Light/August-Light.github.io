# 思路产生

以 Mike 的 [练习 16] 为例。

> 16. Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: Parents should discourage their children from choosing a career that is competitive such as sports or entertainment which are less likely to make them successful.

拿到这个题目，首先注意到一个不同寻常的关键词 **discourage**，那我们可以顺着他说 disagree。

家长给孩子泼冷水，势必闹矛盾关系不好。因此这么说：

> discourage 会让家长和孩子之间产生 conflicts，（\*拿出背过的好词）家长 **be too controlling over their children**。

但是此时话只说了一半，没说出最后的结果：

> 孩子会心情不好，influence relationship，not good for development

第一个点讲完了，第二个点不会了 /(ㄒoㄒ)/~~

答案就在题面上，把已经用掉的部分和废话的例子删掉，看剩余部分：

> ~~Parents should discourage their children~~ from choosing a career that is competitive ~~such as sports or entertainment~~ which are less likely to make them successful.

很容易发现 **competitive** 这个关键词，这就是第二个点。competitive career 有啥好处啊？锻炼人嘛！

> 这类工作其实是 helpful 的。
>
> e.g. sports，training process 很苦，beneficial
>
> develop **mentality**

# 句型构造

中间的部分自己根据思路 freestyle 就行了。看一下开头和结尾。

## Topic Sentence 怎么写？

- **If** + 抄题，sb can ... / **By doing** something, sb can
- **It is adj. for** sb to do ...
- **Doing** something can make sb do / **allow**s sb to do
- **There be** ...

## 结尾句怎么写？

- **This is** very + adj. + for something
- ..., **which is** very + adj. + for something
- It’s very + adj. + for something

这里的 adj. 和 something 怎么填？
- adj.: **helpful / important / useful / beneficial**
- something: **friendships / future / development / health**

## 实操一下！

> - discourage 会让家长和孩子之间产生 conflicts，家长 **be too controlling over their children**。
>   - 孩子会心情不好，influence relationship，not good for development
> - 这类工作其实是 helpful 的。
>   - e.g. sports，training process 很苦，beneficial
>   - develop **mentality**

I believe parents should not discourage their children from pursuing a competitive career for two main reasons.

Firstly, this kind of discouragement **often leads to** conflicts. When parents become too controlling over their children's career choices, they may probably influence children's confidence and negatively impact the relationship, **which is** not good for their development.

Secondly, **it is helpful for children to** work in a competitive field. For example, in fields like sports, although the training process is tough, it is in fact beneficial for children, because it teaches them resilience and how to cope with pressure. **As a result**, this can help them develop a strong mentality.
