> Our rule of thumb is that all expected values should be greater than $5$. Finally, as in all hypothesis tests we’ve looked at, the sample should be randomly chosen from the given population, and, if sampling without replacement, the sample size should be less than $10\%$ of the population size.

- 所有期望值大于 $5$。
- 对于抽样后不放回的样本，样本大小不得超过总体的 $10\%$。
