# Macro

- Promote Economic Growth
- Limit Unemployment
- Keep Prices Stable (Limit Inflation)

# [Unit 12] National Economic Accounts (NEA)

就是一车经济的统计数据。

i.e. Total Personal Income, Corporate Profits, GDP, Real GDP, CPI, PPI, etc.

# [Unit 12] Gross Domestic Product (GDP)

（PPT 12.1）

- shows Quantity in term of dollar
- GDP is part of NEA
- The most important measure of economic growth
- The dollar value of all final goods & services produced within a country in one year
- GDP measures Production, NOT Sales
- A total flow of income and expenditure can be represented by the circular flow diagram

---

（上课笔记）

- Value product
- Within a country (location)
  - Domestic Firms & Foreign Firms
- Within a period (a year)

## Nominal GDP
- Also called **"current-dollar GDP"**

$$\boxed{N.GDP = \sum P_{\text{current}} Q_{\text{current}}}$$

## Real GDP
- Also called **"constant-dollar GDP"**

$$\boxed{R.GDP = \sum P_{\text{base year}} Q_{\text{current}}}$$

## GDP Deflator & Inflation Rate

$$\boxed{\text{GDP Deflator} = \frac {N.GDP} {R.GDP} \times \textcolor{red}{100}}$$

$$\boxed{\text{Inflation Rate} = \% \Delta \text{GDP Deflator}}$$

### 💡 近似计算

（Katie 课）

近似公式：

$$\boxed{\% \Delta \text{GDP Deflator} = \% \Delta N.GDP - \% \Delta R.GDP}$$

准确公式：

$$1 + \% \Delta N.GDP = (1 + \% \Delta \text{GDP Deflator}) (1 + \% \Delta R.GDP)$$

这个近似和下文的 Fisher's Hypothesis 是一样的。

#### Example

> (2015 MCQ #52) Suppose that in a particular country, nominal gross domestic product (GDP) grew by $8$ percent, and the GDP deflator increased by $10$ percent. The country’s growth rate of real GDP would be approximately equal to
> - (A) $-2\%$
> - (B) $-0.8\%$
> - (C) $0.8\%$
> - (D) $2\%$
> - (E) $18\%$

$8\% - 10\% = -2\%$，选择 A。

## GDP Calculation

### The Expenditure Approach

$$\boxed{GDP = C + I + G + X_n}$$

- $C$ is consumption expenditures by households
- $I$ is investment by firms
- $G$ is government purchases
- $X_n$ is net exports
  - $\boxed{X_n = \text{Exports} - \text{Imports}}$

### The Income Approach

$$\boxed{\begin{aligned}
    GDP =& \text{Personal Income} & \text{(Household)} \\
    +& \text{Net Profit} & \text{(Firm)} \\
    +& \text{Tax} & \text{(Gov't)}\\
    +& \text{Depreciation}
\end{aligned}}$$

- Personal Income 不是 Disposable Income！
  - $\boxed{\text{Disposable Income} = \text{Income} - \text{Income Tax}}$
- Firm 是 Net Profit 而不是 Revenue！
- Depreciation 是 Capital 在使用过程中因磨损或技术过时等导致的价值下降，一般会均摊在公司每一年的 cost 中。
  - 为什么要加 Depreciation：
    - $\text{Net Profit} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Cost} - \text{Depreciation}$
    - $\text{Income} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Cost} = \text{Net Profit} + \text{Depreciation}$

### The Valued-added Approach

$$\boxed{GDP = \sum \text{Value added by all firms}}$$

## GDP does not Include

- Underground Economy
  - illegal
  - some legal items and activities
    - DIY
- Second-hand goods
  - e.g. Ebay
- Goods in process
- Transactions that are purely financial
  - e.g. Stock

## Limitations of GDP

- **不能衡量 Happiness（Quality of life / Standard of living）。**
- Only represents the price in the current year, but not the development of technology.

## Per Capita GDP

GDP per Capita is the best measure of a nation’s **standard of living**.

$$\boxed{\text{GDP per capita} = \frac {GDP} {\text{Population}}}$$

一般是 $N.GDP$。

standard of living 可以代表 national income level。

# PRACTICE [Unit 12]

（Chapter 12 书后练习）

- Which of the following is counted in GDP?
  - [YES] Final goods and services purchased by the government
    - $G$ in $C+I+G+X$
  - [NO] Both the peaches used by a bakery to make peach pies and the peach pies
  - [NO] Museum purchases of ancient art
  - [NO] Imported goods and services
  - [NO] Sales of antiques
  - [NO] The estimated value of housework
  - [NO] The value of illegally produced goods and services
  - [NO] The value of stocks, bonds, and other financial assets
  - [YES] The change in business inventories
    - $I$ in $C+I+G+X$
    - Deepseek 说，可以视为企业“购买”了自己的产品。
  - [NO] Secondhand sales

- The cabbages you grow in your summer garden 在 GDP 里怎么算？
  - 不算。因为没卖。

---

- If your grandparents have a new home built for their retirement, this would primarily affect
  - $I$ (Investment).
  - > New residential construction is included in investment even if the home is built by a household.

---

Given:
- Government expenditures $300
- Depreciation $200
- Investment $400
- Consumption expenditures $900
- Taxes $100
- Corporate profits $500
- Exports $200
- Imports $300

GDP equals _____?

(The Expenditure Approach)

- $G$ Government expenditures
- [NO] Depreciation
- $I$ Investment $400
- $C$ Consumption expenditures $900
- [NO] Taxes $100
- [NO] Corporate profits $500
- $X$ Exports $200
- $X$ Imports $300

算出来 $1500。

# [Unit 13] Inflation

## Inflation, Disinflation, and Deflation

- **Inflation** (通货膨胀): a sustained increase in most prices in the economy.
- **Disinflation** (反通货膨胀): when the inflation rate is decreasing, but prices are still rising, not as briskly
- **Deflation** (通货紧缩): when prices are falling.
  - Deflation is bad because people will hoard money and assets.

---

后面遇到的一些东西，整理过来了。

- **Stagflation** (**Double Trouble**) (滞胀): Price Level 高，Unemployment 高。
- **Hyperinflation** (恶性通货膨胀)
- **Depression** (萧条): 大的 **Recession** (衰退)。

## Costs of Inflation

（书 P261）~~这段我还打了个五角星来着，但是完全没印象了~~

- Financial wealth is eroded
- Savings are discouraged
- Menu costs—resources are misallocated with rising prices
- Inflation tax—wealth is redistributed from lenders to borrowers

## Fisher’s Hypothesis

$$\boxed{\text{N. Interest Rate} = \text{R. Interest Rate} + \text{Expected Inflation Rate}}$$

$$\boxed{\text{N. Interest Rate} = \text{R. Interest Rate} + \text{Actual Inflation Rate}}$$

e.g.
- 2022 年我向银行借钱，借 10 年，Real Interest Rate $3\%$，银行预计这 10 年内的 Expected Inflation Rate 为 $4\%$，根据第一条公式算出 Nominal Interest Rate 为 $7\%$。
- 2024 年遇上 COVID-19，Actual Inflation Rate 达到 $10\%$，但是 Nominal Interest Rate 是在合同上写死的不能变，依然是 $7\%$，根据第二条公式算出此时的 Real Interest Rate 为 $-3\%$，我赚麻了。

> (2019 MCQ #20) Which of the following is true about inflation and interest rates?
> - (A) The higher the inflation rate, the higher the real interest rate.
> - (B) If there is no actual or in expected inflation, the nominal and real interest rate are equal.
> - (C) If the economy is experiencing deflation, the nominal interest rate exceeds the real interest rate.
> - (D) The higher the inflation rate, the lower the nominal interest rate.
> - (E) The nominal interest rate is the difference between the real interest rate and the expected inflation rate.
>
> Answer: (B)

💡 其实它真实的样子是这样：

$$1 + NIR = (1 + RIR) (1 + \text{Expected Inflation Rate})$$

只是忽略了一个特别小的项。

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher_equation>

## Consumer Price Index (CPI)

（PPT 13.2）

The most commonly used measurement of inflation for consumers.

- 只包含生活中常用的消费品（即并非全部产品）
  - 随着时间的变化，这个 basket 也会变化。
  - e.g. 房子不算，房租算。奢侈品不算。
- Includes prices of imported goods

$$\boxed{CPI = \frac {\text{Price of market basket}} {\text{Price of market basket in base year}} \times \textcolor{red}{100}}$$

$$\boxed{\text{Inflation Rate} = \% \Delta CPI}$$

算出来的 Inflation Rate 可能和 Deflator 算出来的不一样，但是总体趋势是相同的。

（小王的课）

💡 具体计算中可能会用到的：

$$CPI = \frac {\sum P_{\text{current}} Q_{\text{base year}}} {\sum P_{\text{base year}} Q_{\text{base year}}} \times \textcolor{red}{100}$$

都是 Base year 的 Quantity 哦！

### Example: Calculation of CPI

|  | $P_1$ | $Q_1$ | $P_2$ | $Q_2$ |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Base Year | 30 | 20 | 10 | 10 |
| Current Year | 40 | 10 | 50 | 10 |

$$CPI = \frac {40 \times 20 + 50 \times 10} {30 \times 20 + 10 \times 10} \times 100$$

### Problems with CPI

(PPT 13.2)

- As prices increase for the fixed market basket, consumers buy less of these products and more substitutes that may not be part of the market basket.
- The CPI market basket may not include the newest consumer products.
- The CPI ignores both improvements and decline in product quality.
- the CPI can overstate cost of living increases.

# [Unit 13] Unemployment

Unemployment: Do not have a job & Looking for a job **actively**

$$\boxed{\text{Unemployment rate} = \frac {\text{\# Unemployed}} {\text{\# Labor Force}} \times 100\%}$$

## Types of Unemployment

（PPT 13.1）

1. Structured Unemployment (location, condition)
2. Seasoned Unemployment (nature of business)
3. Cyclical Unemployment (business cycle)
4. Frictional Unemployment (Between jobs)

Full employment: 失业率 $\boxed{4\% \sim 6\%}$，只有 1 和 4。

## Labor Force

（PPT 13.1）

- At least 16 years old
- Able and willing to work
- **NOT** institutionalized (in jails or hospitals)
- **NOT** in military, in school full time, or retired
- **NOT** in between jobs (frictional)
