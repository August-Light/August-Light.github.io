Behaviorism: an empirically rigorous science focused on observable behaviors.

## Learning

- learning: acquiring new and relatively enduring information or behaviors.
- associative learning: links certain events, behaviors, or stimuli together in the process of conditioning

**Classical conditioning** and **operant conditioning** are 2 types of associative learning.

## 「1」Classical conditioning

<!--经典条件作用-->

A type of learning in which one learns to **link 2 or more stimuli and anticipate events**.

### Pavlov's dog

- Before conditioning
  - food (**unconditioned stimulus**) -> drooling (**unconditioned response**)
  - sound (**neutral stimulus**) -> no drooling
- During conditioning
  - food + sound -> drooling [acquisition]
- After conditioning
  - sound (**conditioned stimulus**) -> drooling (**conditioned response**)

### Watson's Little Albert experiment

- Before conditioning
  - noise (unconditioned stimulus) -> fear (unconditioned response)
  - rat (neutral stimulus) -> no fear
- During conditioning
  - noise + rat -> fear
- After conditioning
  - rat (conditioned stimulus) -> fear (conditioned response)

## 「2」Operant conditioning

<!--操作性条件作用-->

- reinforcer -> behavior strengthened
- punisher -> behavior diminished

### Skinner Box

the mouse touches button -> gets food (reward) -> behavior strengthened

### Types of reinforcement

- Positive reinforcement: give something good -> **strengthen behavior**
- Negative reinforcement: remove something bad -> **strengthen behavior**

### Types of reinforcer

- Primary reinforcer: an innately reinforcing stimulus (you don't have to learn it)
- Conditioned reinforcer: associate with a primary reinforcer

### Reinforcement schedule

- reinforcement schedule: pattern of how often the desired response will be reinforced
  - continuous reinforcement
  - **partial reinforcement**: not reinforcing all the responses, but leads to greater resistance to **extinction**
    - e.g. a free cup of coffee for every 10 you buy

## 「1」Continuous Schedules of Reinforcement

- the desired behavior is reinforced every single time it occurs.
- **most effective** when **teaching** a new behavior.

## 「2」Partial Schedules of Reinforcement

|  | Fixed | Variable |
| - | - | - |
| Ratio | fixed number of response <br/> -> **high, steady** rate of response | unpredictable number of response <br/> -> **high, steady rate** of response |
| Interval | fixed amount of time <br/> -> **high** rate at the end of interval, **slower** response after the reinforcer is delivered  | unpredictable namount of time <br/> -> **low, steady** rate of response |

- Partial schedules reduce the risk of satiation.

## Side effects of extinction

- response burst: temporarily increases in amount, magnitude, or duration (*Try more!*)
- response variability: use other problematic behaviors to get the same response (*Try some other ways!*)
