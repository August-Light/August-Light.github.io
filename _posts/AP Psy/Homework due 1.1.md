The video first introduces three ways of accessing memory: **recall**, **recognition**, and **relearning**. These concepts can be easily understood with the example of school exams: fill-in-the-blank problems rely on recall, multiple-choice questions requires recognition, and reviewing old materials is the process of relearning.

Next, the video explains how memory is stored. Information first becomes **sensory memory**, and then is encoded in to **working memory**, and eventually either decays or is stored in **long-term memory**. Working memory involves both **explicit** and **implicit** processes. Long-term memory also comes in different forms, including **procedural** memory and **episodic** memory.

Finally, the video illustrates some memory tricks, such as **mnemonics** and **chunking**. It also elaborates on the difference between **shallow and deep processing**. Because deep processing requires one to understand the actual meaning instead of staying on the literal expression, the memory could be retained longer.

> 1. What is capitalization (or social mobility)? Do you think China has strong capitalization?

Capitalization rate is the percentage of people in any group who are able to reach their potential capitalize on their potential.

I think China's capitalization is strong in some respects. China has broad coverage in basic education, and really emphasizes STEM subjects. China also has the *Gaokao* serving as an extremely fair test for selection. However, China is reletively weak in recognizing and cultivating non-standard potential, like creativity.

> 2. According to Eisner's research, are there many poor smart kids in the USA? 

Yes. Every year there are about 35,000 students who score in the top 10% in SAT in one shot, and who come from families having financial issues. They even do not have tutors and do not go to high schools with a lot of AP courses.

(By the way, it is actually Huxby (or Hawksby?) and Avery's research, not Eisner's.)

> 3. How did Malcolm describe Lennox middle school?

It looked like a concentration camp. There was a police cruiser driving, and there were even solitary confinement cells for stashing students.

> 4. If elite institutions offer free tuition to low income, high achieving students, why is the application rate so low?

Eric believes it is because the education system starts looking for these kids too late. He thinks they should have to start finding when the kids are in fourth grade, the time when their talent shows up. He argues that if the kids are not encouraged, after adolescence their excitement of being smart would fade away.

> 5. Why did Carlos decline the scholarship to boarding school?

He did not decline the opportunity - he really wanted to go. However, his mom stopped him because if he stayed, he could take care of her and his sister.

> 6. Where is Carlos' mother?

She is in prison in Texas.

> 7. Why do you think Carlos and the boy in fourth grade forget these events?

- For Carlos: In order to succeed in academic performance, he must suppress memories about shame (the oversized shoes) or overwhelm (taking care of his family). After putting everything else in a box, he could finally entirely focus on his studies.
- For the fourth-grade boy: He did not *forget* the memory. However, because the memory of the violence was too horrible, his mind detached the memory from his emotion.
